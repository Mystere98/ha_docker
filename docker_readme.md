# Docker Compose Infos / Commands

Docker commands should be executed in the folder where the docker-compose.yml file resides, in my case that is for example `~/docker/home_assistant`

## Shutdown, update and restart all stacks / container

just run "./update_docker.sh" in the docker folder

## Cleanup

docker system prune
